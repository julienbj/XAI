# Thinking Inside the Box: Shapley Values for Explainable AI

This repository contains the source code and materials for the report titled **"Thinking Inside the Box: Shapley Values for Explainable AI"**, created as part of the project coursework for **STK-MAT2011** at the **University of Oslo**.

## Abstract

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integral to decision-making processes, it is crucial to ensure that these models are transparent, fair, and interpretable. Explainable AI (XAI) seeks to address the issue of *"black-box"* models by providing insights into their decision-making processes.

Among many methods developed for this purpose, **Shapley values** stand out due to their solid theoretical foundation in cooperative game theory, offering a fair allocation of feature importance in model predictions. This report explores the use of Shapley values in XAI, beginning with a theoretical introduction to the concept and its role in model interpretability. 

Through a simulation study, we compare the performance of different estimation methods for Shapley values. The report concludes with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of these estimation methods.
